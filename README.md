# Bayesian Analysis South Atlantic

A probabilistic framework using Bayes' Theorem to estimate origin of plastic in the South Atlantic.

How does this code works?

`SAG_experiment.py` is the script that runs the OceanParcels simulation. But in order to run it, you need to generate the the support files by running `python/landmask.py`.

All the scripts that deal with the probabilistic analysis are in the `python` directory.
